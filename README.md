+ in the documentation can you write in short bullet points all the touch points to code new modules in the emails? For example right now we have a portfolio module that takes the drive assets and inserts when required (you'd have already done this). 

Similarly in future, if I need to code a proposal module that writes and sends a proposal (as a drive link) then what do I need to do...as in what all touch points in code are important to cross check / update. I plan to include two new modules after you give the code: Proposal module + contracts module. Then I'll just turn on the system and go to peaceful sleep.
